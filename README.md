# The Odin Project: Calculator
This is my solution to Odin's [Calculator project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/calculator).

Live version: https://nc-sua.github.io/odin-calculator/

## To do
- Disable appending to displayed value after completed calculation
- Backspace button (replaces non-functioning square root)
- +/- button
- Handle overflow and sizing
- ~~Keyboard support~~
- Nicer font and symbols
